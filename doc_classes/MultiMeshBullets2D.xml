		<method name="disable_bullet">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="bullet_index" type="int" />
			<description>
				Disable a specific bullet from the multimesh
				Always call using call_deferred() to avoid issues

		<method name="get_all_bullets_status">
			<return type="bool[]" />
			<description>
				Get the status of all bullets inside the multimesh - whether they are enabled (active and visible on screen) or disabled (inactive and invisible)
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_amount_bullets" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Get the amount of bullets inside the multimesh

		<method name="is_bullet_status_enabled">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="bullet_index" type="int" />
			<description>
				Check the status of a specific bullet - whether it is enabled (active and visible on screen) or disabled (inactive and invisible)

		<method name="multimesh_attach_time_based_function">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="time" type="float" />
			<param index="1" name="callable" type="Callable" />
			<param index="2" name="repeat" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Attaches a callable that gets executed after a certain amount of time.
				If you set the repeat argument to true, then the callable will keep executing forever.

				If you want to be able to detach the callable, then make sure that it is clearly declared outside as a variable or you could even use a normal Godot function.

				Callables that execute bullet related functions have no need of using call_deferred(), since all attached callables are executed at the end of the frame by default for safety.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="multimesh_detach_all_time_based_functions">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Detaches all time based functions that were previously attached.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="multimesh_detach_time_based_function">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="callable" type="Callable" />
			<description>
				Detaches a specific time based callable. This will work as long as the callable you are trying to detach
				was previously saved in a variable or defined as a normal Godot function.

			If you set to true, then the lifetime will be ignored and bullets will never be destroyed.

			Warning: If you don't implement "collision walls" or anything else to intercept/collide with the bullets, then they will truly live forever in your memory and you will experience lag.
