		<method name="on_bullet_disable" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Executed when the attachment is disabled before it goes to the object pool. You should provide disable logic - attachment gets invisible/disables specific functionality or children etc...

		<method name="on_bullet_enable" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Executed when the attachment is enabled again from the object pool. You should provide activation logic - attachment gets visible/enabled etc..

		<method name="on_bullet_spawn" qualifiers="virtual">

			<description>
				Ensure the attachment is in disabled state (example: attachment should be invisible when you are populating the object pool... in the same state as in the [method on_bullet_disable] function).

				Warning: The [BulletAttachment2D] is not yet in the scene tree when this method is executed, so don't call functions that depend on already configured children etc.. instead use [code]_ready[/code]. Just save state specific logic in variables and then later in [code]_ready[/code] handle that.
