	<brief_description>
		Provides the functionality of bullets being able to carry particles or other nodes as they move.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		In order for attachments to work correctly they need a unique [member attachment_id] positive value.
		The way you use attachments is the following:
		1. Create a new scene that has a parent node of [BulletAttachment2D].
		2. Add any other nodes to the scene or logic to it - whatever the bullets are going to be carrying as they move.
		3. Set the [member attachment_id] inside [method on_bullet_spawn] and [method on_bullet_spawn_as_disabled] functions.
		4. Configure any other custom logic in the rest of the functions (read the rest of the documentation carefully, you need to override the virtual functions to execute custom logic).
		5. Set this attachment to a spawn data ([BlockBulletsData2D] or [DirectionalBulletsData2D]) by using [member MultimeshBulletsData2D.attachment_scenes] property and use one of [BulletFactory2D]'s spawn functions to spawn the actual bullets.

	<methods>
		<method name="on_bullet_enable" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Executed when the attachment is enabled again from the object pool. You should provide activation logic - attachment gets visible/enabled etc..

				Note: This function gets executed over and over again since attachment object pooling is used.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="on_bullet_disable" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Executed when the attachment is disabled before it goes to the object pool. You should provide disable logic - attachment gets invisible/disables specific functionality or children etc...

				Note: This function gets executed over and over again since attachment object pooling is used.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="on_bullet_load" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="custom_data_to_load" type="Resource" />
			<description>
				Executed when the attachment is being loaded from a save data resource. The [code]custom_data_to_load[/code] is the same data that has been saved from [method on_bullet_save] function.
				This is the place where you should load all the data that you had saved previously - cast the class back to your custom resource type and access the properties you need.

				Note: Always check if [code]custom_data_to_load[/code] is [code]null[/code] or not or you may experience crashes in some cases.
				Note: The [BulletAttachment2D] is not yet in the scene tree when this method is executed, so don't call functions that depend on already configured children etc.. instead use [code]_ready[/code]. Just save state specific logic in variables and then later in [code]_ready[/code] handle that.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="on_bullet_save" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<description>
				Executed when the attachment is being saved.
				Create a brand new custom resource, populate it with data and then return it from this function.
				[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdRJqnOrz98&amp;t=4s]YouTube Tutorial On Custom Resources For Beginners[/url]
				Next up you are going to handle the loading of all that data inside the [method on_bullet_load] function.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="on_bullet_spawn" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Executed before the attachment gets added to the scene tree.
				This is the place where you should set a unique positive value for the [member attachment_id] property. The object pooling logic depends on it.

				Note: The [BulletAttachment2D] is not yet in the scene tree when this method is executed, so don't call functions that depend on already configured children etc.. instead use [code]_ready[/code]. Just save state specific logic in variables and then later in [code]_ready[/code] handle that.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="on_bullet_spawn_as_disabled" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				This is a special case function. The [BulletFactory2D] uses it when it populates the attachment object pool. 
				You are required to set the same [member attachment_id] that you did in the [method on_bullet_spawn] function.
				Ensure the attachment is in disabled state (example: attachment should be invisible when you are populating the object pool... in the same state as in the [method on_bullet_disable] function).

				Note: The [BulletAttachment2D] is not yet in the scene tree when this method is executed, so don't call functions that depend on already configured children etc.. instead use [code]_ready[/code]. Just save state specific logic in variables and then later in [code]_ready[/code] handle that.

		<member name="attachment_id" type="int" setter="set_attachment_id" getter="get_attachment_id" default="0">
			The object pooling logic depends on this value. Make sure that no other [BulletAttachment2D] has the same [member attachment_id]. 
			Also ensure that the value is positive and that you are setting it in the [method on_bullet_spawn] and [method on_bullet_spawn_as_disabled] functions.

		<member name="stick_relative_to_bullet" type="bool" setter="set_stick_relative_to_bullet" getter="get_stick_relative_to_bullet" default="true">
			Determines whether the attachment should "stick" to the bullets or not. If set to [code]false[/code], then the attachments won't rotate along with the bullets.
